Hello! this is only my second ever repository so im not sure how to credit n stuff or if i even should; anyways if you havent already go take a look at grassmunk's page on github, he has a lot of cool stuff and was a big inspiration for this little silly project of mine.
for the themes pick one from  the "themes" folder and for the window themes pick one from  the "xfwm themes" folder.
ill probably add some way to match wallpapers and themes so that they look ok for now just take my word for it:
Golden Poppy -> golden poppy.jpg
Rio Azul -> rio azul.png
Gray Space -> 134.png
Mac Default -> quantum foam or mac os default
Blue Mono -> #636395 hex as a background color
Roswell  -> ufo1.jpg or ufo2.jpg
